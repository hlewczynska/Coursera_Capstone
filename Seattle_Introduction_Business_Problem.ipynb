I know.. expensive right!\n\nI have toyed with the idea of setting up a dogwalking buisness as I love my furry friends and now have a pup of my own called Ellie.\n\nSo, the questions are: \n\n1. Which neighbourhoods suit my family and I?\n\n2. Which neighborhoods in Seattle are most likely to require someone to walk their dog?\n\n3. Do any of these neighbourhoods provide the best of both worlds?\n\nIn this project, I will attempt to answer the above questions. First I will explore the best neighborhoods that fit my own family life. Next, I will find which neighborhoods in Seattle would probably need a dog walker. Finally, I will try and find out which areas would provide the best of both!\n\nTo complete this task, I will use Foursquare location data to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood and map which neighborhoods contain our favorite ones. Then i will use some data i found on Seattle pet populations to find which neighborhoods contain the most dogs and of what breed. Lastly i will try to analyse which neigborhoods would best suit my lifestyle but also give me the ability to start up my dog walking buisness.\n\n# Methodology\n\nIn this project, I am trying to explore neighborhoods in Seattle that would be suitable for myself and a new buisness.\n\nThe stakeholders of this project is therefore myself and my family.\n\nTo complete this task, i will perform the following steps:\n\n- Collecting data: Including Seattle Neighborhood data, venues nearby each neighborhood which will be generated by Foursquare API and pet data from the Seattle Open Source Website\n- Exploratory data analysis to better understand our working dataset.\n- Creating Map of Seattle with Folium library overlaying neighborhood characteristics and pet data.\n- Anlaysing which neighbourhoods we should consider based on analysis of pets and venues."
